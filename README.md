# SaaS and Admin Frontend

This web application, built with Angular and Angular Material UI, provides a responsive and user-friendly interface for managing tasks and user profiles in a SaaS environment. The app integrates with a Django backend API to offer secure registration and login features, with IP verification and email notifications to ensure user safety. The app includes powerful charting libraries such as ngCharts and ApexCharts to provide detailed analytics on user tasks, and allows users to create, edit, and assign tasks to themselves or others. The app also includes notifications for overdue or upcoming tasks, and allows users to view their own profile information and task count. Overall, the Angular frontend provides an intuitive and customizable experience for users of the SaaS application.

You can access the demo of the application by visiting [https://admin-intern.firebaseapp.com/](https://admin-intern.firebaseapp.com/). While the registration invite is intended for use by admins only, you can still send a registration invite to yourself to explore its features.
